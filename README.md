# Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to identify employees that are near retirement, as well as employees that are eligible for a mentorship program.  We want to be able to group these by job titles and other slices that we may be interested in.  We want to gather other employee attributes in our data such as employee numbers, start and end dates, job titles, etc.,

## Results
The first metric that we notice is the high number of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff that is close to retirement.  The combined number is over 50,000 employees.  On the other end, those two groups also lead the mentorship eligibility columns.  See visuals below.  What is most concerning is the % of total employee that could retire soon. Out of the ~300k employees, we realize that almost 25% of the workforce is about to retire.  Over 70% of the employees eligible for mentorship are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff.  Out of the 1,549 employees that are eligible, 1,098 are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff

--Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are only 1.549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.  This does not seem like enough to mentor the next generation of employees.
